# Project PS001: Database Full Backup Instruction Guide 
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This document exclusively outlines the contingency procedure for performing a full database backup for the project PS001.  
> It is intended as an additional insurance measure in the event that the RAID recovery mechanism fails to restore data as expected.   
> The scope of this document does NOT include RAID configuration, recovery procedures, or related agreements.  
  
## Prerequisites  
To execute the backup procedure successfully, ensure the following requirements are met:  
* Physical access to the project PS001 site, specifically the project room jump host.  
* A USB pendrive with sufficient storage capacity to hold the full database dump.  
* Credential and IP address details for the involved systems can be obtained from project PIC.  
  
## Step-by-Step Backup Procedure  
### 1. Establish SSH Connection to IPC machine  
Initiate a secure shell session from the jump host to the IPC machine where the database resides.  
```
$ ssh <username>@<ipc_ip_address>
```
<sub>Replace <username> and <ipc_ip_address> with the appropriate credentials and IP address provided by PIC.</sub>  
  
### 2. Execute Full Database Dump Using mysqldump  
Run the following command to generate a full logical backup of the MySQL database:  
```
$ mysqldump --all-databases --routines --events --triggers --single-transaction --quick --lock-tables=false -u root -p > "/tmp/dbs_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql"
```
  
### 3. Transfer Backup File to Jump Host  
Use portable [WinSCP](https://winscp.net) to securely copy the backup file from the IPC machine to the jump host.  
  
### 4. Copy Backup File to USB Pendrive  
Mount the USB pendrive on the jump host and copy the backup file.   
  
## Restore Procedure  
Run the following command:  
```
$ mysql -u root -p < <mysql_dump_sql_file>
```
<sub>Replace <mysql_dump_sql_file> with the appropriate filename.</sub>  
  
  
> [!CAUTION]  
> After completing this operation, please ensure:  
> Do NOT leave any credentials behind, log out of all systems and sessions to maintain security.
